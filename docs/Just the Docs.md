# Just the Docs
**Just the Docs** is built for a static site generator, that is called Jekyll. **Just the Docs** gives your documentation a jumpstart with a responsive Jekyll theme that is easily customizable and hosted on GitHub Pages.  
[Just the Docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/)  

# Jekyll
**Jekyll** is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal projects, or organization sites. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown templates, and spits out a complete, static website.

# Username.github.io
In order to create a site with the help of **Just the Docs** your **Username.github.io** should contain the following folders and files.

## 1. _includes  
It's a folder with SVG files (in case you have them. If not, you don't need such a folder).

## 2. assets/images  
This folder contains JPGs, PNGs and PDFs.
