# Essential components of Visual Studio Code
VS Code comes with a straight-forward and intuitive layout that maximizes the space provided for the editor while leaving ample room to browse. Additionally, it allows access to the full context of your folder or project. The User Interface is divided into **five areas**:

1. **Editor** – It is the main area to edit your files. You can open as many editors as possible side by side vertically and horizontally.
2. **SideBar** – Contains different views like the Explorer to assist you while working on your project.
3. **Status Bar** – It contains the information about the opened project and the files you edit.
4. **Activity Bar** – It is located on the far left-hand side. It lets you switch between views and gives you additional context-specific indicators, like the number of outgoing changes when Git is enabled.
5. **Panels** – It displays different panels below the editor region for output or debug information, errors, and warnings, or an integrated terminal. Additionally, the panel can also move to the right for more vertical space.

**Available views:**

1. **Explorer** is used to browse, open, and manage all of the files and folders in your project. After opening a folder in VS Code, the contents of the folder are shown in the Explorer. You can do many things from here:  
* Create, delete, and rename files and folders.
* Move files and folders with drag and drop.
* Use the context menu to explore all options.  
2. **Search** - Provides global search and replace across your open folder.  
3. **Source Control** - VS Code includes Git source control by default.  
4. **Run** - VS Code's Run and Debug View displays variables, call stacks, and breakpoints.  
5. **Extensions** - Install and manage your extensions within VS Code.

# Markdown and Visual Studio Code  
Markdown is a formatting language used when the resulting document will be rendered or converted into **HTML** documents for web-viewable material. The format is commonly used to generate documents like readme’s in GitHub or blog posts. Markdown documents are written in plain text, and thus are often simpler to create, edit and manage using text editors intended for writing code.  

VS Code supports Markdown files out of the box. You just start writing Markdown text, save the file with the **.md extension** and then you can toggle the visualization of the editor between the code and the preview of the Markdown file; obviously, you can also open an existing Markdown file and start working with it. To switch between views, press **Ctrl+Shift+V** in the editor. 

The Outline view is a separate section in the bottom of the File Explorer. When expanded, it will show the symbol tree of the currently active editor. For Markdown files, the symbol tree is the Markdown file's header hierarchy.
