# Creating a new repository  
1. If you do not have any repositories associated with GitHub Desktop, you will see a "Let's get started!" view, where you can choose to create and clone a tutorial repository, clone an existing repository from the Internet, create a new repository, or add an existing repository from your hard drive.
2. Click Create a New Repository on your Hard Drive.
3. Fill in the fields and select your preferred options.  
* "Name" defines the name of your repository both locally and on GitHub.  
* "Description" is an optional field that you can use to provide more information about the purpose of your repository.  
* "Local path" sets the location of your repository on your computer. By default, GitHub Desktop creates a GitHub folder inside your Documents folder to store your repositories, but you can choose any location on your computer. Your new repository will be a folder inside the chosen location. For example, if you name your repository Tutorial, a folder named Tutorial is created inside the folder you selected for your local path. GitHub Desktop remembers your chosen location the next time you create or clone a new repository.  
* Initialize this repository with a README creates an initial commit with a README.md file. READMEs helps people understand the purpose of your project, so we recommend selecting this and filling it out with helpful information. When someone visits your repository on GitHub, the README is the first thing they'll see as they learn about your project. For more information, see "About READMEs."  
* The Git ignore drop-down menu lets you add a custom file to ignore specific files in your local repository that you don't want to store in version control. If there's a specific language or framework that you'll be using, you can select an option from the available list. If you're just getting started, feel free to skip this selection. For more information, see "Ignoring files."  
* The License drop-down menu lets you add an open-source license to a LICENSE file in your repository. You don't need to worry about adding a license right away. For more information about available open-source licenses and how to add them to your repository, see "Licensing a repository."
4. Click Create repository.
