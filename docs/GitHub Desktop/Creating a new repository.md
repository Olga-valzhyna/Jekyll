# Creating a new repository  
1. If you do not have any repositories associated with GitHub Desktop, you will see a **"Let's get started!"** view, where you can choose to create and clone a tutorial repository, clone an existing repository from the Internet, create a new repository, or add an existing repository from your hard drive.
2. Click **Create a New Repository** on your Hard Drive.
3. Fill in the fields and select your preferred options.  
* **"Name"** defines the name of your repository both locally and on GitHub.  
* **"Description"** is an optional field that you can use to provide more information about the purpose of your repository.  
* **"Local path"** sets the location of your repository on your computer. By default, GitHub Desktop creates a GitHub folder inside your Documents folder to store your repositories, but you can choose any location on your computer. Your new repository will be a folder inside the chosen location. For example, if you name your repository Tutorial, a folder named Tutorial is created inside the folder you selected for your local path. GitHub Desktop remembers your chosen location the next time you create or clone a new repository.  
* **Initialize this repository with a README** creates an initial commit with a README.md file. READMEs help people understand the purpose of your project. When someone visits your repository on GitHub, the README is the first thing they'll see as they learn about your project.  
* The **Git ignore** drop-down menu lets you add a custom file to ignore specific files in your local repository that you don't want to store in version control. If there's a specific language or framework that you'll be using, you can select an option from the available list. If you're just getting started, feel free to skip this selection.  
* The **License** drop-down menu lets you add an open-source license to a LICENSE file in your repository. You don't need to worry about adding a license right away.
