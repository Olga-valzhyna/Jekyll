# Markdown  
Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files. Nearly all Markdown applications support the basic syntax outlined in John Gruber’s original design document.

# Headers  
To create a header, preface the phrase with a hash mark (#). You place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header you want. For example, for a header one, you'd use one hash mark, while for a header three, you'd use three. 

## ex. 2 Customer
### ex. 3 Project manager
#### ex. 4 Product owner
##### ex. 5 Developer
###### ex. 6 Technical writer

# Paragraphs  
To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text. You
should not indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs.  
**ex. Technical writing is not just about understanding technical information and recording it in a document.**  

**Technical writing takes high-level information and processes it into digestible content for a specific audience.**

# Line Breaks  
To create a line break , end a line with two or more spaces, and then type
return.  
**ex. A technical writer is a professional writer that communications complex information.**  
*So what exactly does a technical writer do?*  
**They create technical documentation that includes things like instruction manuals, user manuals, journal articles, quick reference guides, and white papers.**

# Emphasis:  
## Bold  
To bold text, add two asterisks (*) before and after a word or phrase. To
bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the
letters.  
ex. **Attention to detail with a creative eye.**

## Italic  
To italicize text, add one asterisk before and after a word or phrase. To
italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around
the letters.  

ex. *Passionate about learning and developing.*

# Blockquotes  
To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.  
ex. Mark Zuckerberg believes:
> Some people dream of success... while others wake up and work hard at it.

# Lists:  
## Numbered Lists  
To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The
numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.  
1. Jira
2. Confluence
3. Brackets
4. Visual Studio Code
5. MadCap Flare
6. Snagit
7. Camtasia
8. MemoQ
9. Oxygen
10. GitHub Desktop 

## Bullet Lists  
To create an unordered list, add asterisks (*) in front of line items.  
* Technical communication
* Web technologies
    * HTML
    * CSS
* Technical texts

# Images  
To add an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally add a title after the URL in the parentheses.

# Links

## Linking Images  
To add a link to an image, enclose the Markdown for the image in brackets, and then add the link in parentheses.

## Linking URL
To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses.  
[Visit GitHub!](www.github.com)

# Tables  
To add a table, use three or more hyphens (---) to create each column’s header, and use pipes (|) to separate each column. You can optionally add pipes on either end of the table.  
| header 1    | header 2    |  
| -------------| -------------|  
| course 1    | course 2    |  
| something  | something  |  

# Alignment  
You can align text in the columns to the left, right, or center by adding a colon (:) to the left, right, or on both side of the hyphens within the header row.

# Code  
To indicate a span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (`). Unlike a pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates code within a normal paragraph.

ex. Specify `x=7;` when x equals two.

To include a literal backtick character within a code span, you can use multiple backticks as the opening and closing delimiters.  
```
ex. x=7;
    y=17;
    z=x+y;
```
